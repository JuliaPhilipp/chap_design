  Abstract =	 {The diversity of a species assemblage has been studied extensively for
                  many decades in relation to its possible connection with ecosystem
                  functioning and organization. In this view most diversity measures, such
                  as Shannon's entropy, rely upon information the ory as a basis for the
                  quantification of diversity. Also, traditional diversity measures are
                  computed using species relative abundances and cannot account for the
                  ecological differences between species. Rao first proposed a diversity
                  index, termed quadratic diversity (Q ) that incorporates both species
                  relative abundances and pairwise distances between species. Quadratic
                  diversity is traditionally defin ed as the expected distance between two
                  randomly selected individuals. In this paper, we show that quadratic
                  diversity can be interpret ed as the expected conflict among the species
                  of a given assemblage. From this unusual interpretation, it naturally
                  follows that Rao's Q can be related to the Shannon entropy through a
                  generalized version of the Tsallis parametric entropy.},

  Abstract =	 {We have applied "whole-genome shotgun sequencing" to microbial
                  populations collected en masse on tangential flow and impact filters
                  from seawater samples collected from the Sargasso Sea near Bermuda. A
                  total of 1.045 billion base pairs of nonredundant sequence was
                  generated, annotated, and analyzed to elucidate the gene content,
                  diversity, and relative abundance of the organisms within these
                  environmental samples. These data are estimated to derive from at least
                  1800 genomic species based on sequence relatedness, including 148
                  previously unknown bacterial phylotypes. We have identified over 1.2
                  million previously unknown genes represented in these samples, including
                  more than 782 new rhodopsin-like photoreceptors. Variation in species
                  present and stoichiometry suggests substantial oceanic microbial
                  diversity.},
